Beginner-Intermidiate guide to Linux Desktop

The project is made on the assumption that readers don't want to 'read' long explainations, and that examples are an effective way to learn. If you are looking for something extensive try [this](https://linux-training.be/linuxfun.pdf). I will try to provide a link to a web page where it is extensively documented for people who are interested.

If you are confused about something, it is documented somewhere whether on [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), forums, Reddit, or even youtube. 

## Prerequisites
- A linux distro installed in your computer. (beginner-friendly distro very highly reccomended)
  - A Desktop Environment (GUI)
  - Terminal emulator
  - File manager (Optional)

> [!NOTE]   
> All mainstream desktop distributions will work.
