Beginner-Intermidiate guide to Linux Desktop

This guide will not explain history, go deep into a subject. The guide is to let new users start using their computer quickly. If you are looking for something extensive try [this](https://linux-training.be/linuxfun.pdf). I am trying to make it simple and straight-forward (so I might often skip explanation and jump to work) and try to provide a link to a web page where it is extensively documented for people who are interested.

If you are confused about something, it is documented somewhere whether on reddit, [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), forums, or even youtube. 

## Prerequisites
- A linux distro installed in your computer. (beginner-friendly distro very highly reccomended)
  - A Desktop Environment (GUI)
  - Terminal emulator
  - File manager (Optional)
  - A Web Browser
- Internet connection

> [!NOTE]   
> All mainstream desktop distributions will work.
