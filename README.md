Beginner-Intermidiate guide to Linux Desktop

> [!NOTE]  
> This is not profesional advice, just a personal note/collection. Here is [better one](https://linuxnewbieguide.org/overview-of-chapters/)  

The project is a quick start guide to Desktop Linux. It is not perfect. I might have written too much or missed some concepts. Even the name is not final. If you are looking for something extensive try [this](https://linux-training.be/linuxfun.pdf). I will try to provide a link to a web page where it is extensively documented for people who are interested.

If you are confused about something, it is documented somewhere whether on [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), forums, Reddit, or even youtube. 

## Prerequisites
- A linux distro installed in your computer. (beginner-friendly distro very highly reccomended)
  - A Desktop Environment (GUI)
  - Terminal emulator
  - File manager (Optional: for viewing changes live)
