## Beginning - The terminal
The terminal is the first and last thing in linux. You dont really have to it, but you aren't a penguin user if you don't. 

**What is a terminal?**  
A terminal is a program that lets you interact with your computer by typing commands instead of clicking. It’s a text-based control panel or the Command Line Interference (CLI). 

**Why use a CLI when we have GUIs?**  
- It’s direct and fast.  
- It’s scriptable and automatable.  
- It’s predictable and consistent across systems.  
- It’s ideal for remote work and servers.  
- It exposes powerful features without hunting through menus.


### Starting the terminal.
You can launch the terminal like any other app. Open application launcher, which usually can be done by pressing the Super key*. Then type `TERMINAL` and press enter or click on the first option.
*Windows key is called Super key in windows.
